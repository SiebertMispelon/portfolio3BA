                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Siebert Mispelon (Â°1996, Gent, Belgium) is an artist who works in a variety of media. At the moment his work mostly consists out of 3D generated imagery and video installations. His work mainly focuses on how he tries to understand and experiences the world around him. He has a strong fascination towards the concept of reality. He is trying to create his own metaverse where different themes, phil- osophical ideas, rational concepts, formal decisions and intuitive choices merge together.<br><br>He approaches his work like alternate realities whose meaning you might rather absorb than decode. They often feel like places where a distinctive mind has messed with the world of objects and mean- ing. He tries to develop forms that do not follow logical criteria, but are often based on subjective associations and formal parallels. Which incite the viewer to make new personal associations. Multilay- ered images arise in which the fragility and instability of our seem- ingly certain reality are questioned.<br><br>He looks at the digital and virtual world as an extension of the phys- ical world. He is interested in the idea of embodied and disembod- ied realities. The experience of the viewer plays an important role within these ideas and is a central element within his discission mak- ing process. He tries to create certain scenarios where the viewer gets pushed in and gets pulled out of the art work. He often uses different strategies to trigger the viewer. He is interested in a sort of immediate seduction of the viewer, but also wants to create a lay- ered image where you can keep discovering new things.<br><br>As a starting point the space is always an important factor, when he is working on new projects he always keeps the space in mind where he will show his work or imagines a fictional one. The way he deals with the space is often part of the artwork itself. He likes to create certain kinds of environments. He is interested in the idea of an exhibition as a Fictional Space. <br>In the future he also wants to ex- press himself trough curatorial projects.</p>
